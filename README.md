# Analysis of Image Classification using SVM

This repository summarizes the work presented in the IEEE paper, _“Analysis of Image Classification using SVM”_. The study explores the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for image classification tasks with a focus on optimizing decision boundaries and evaluating performance on distinct datasets.

## Abstract
The paper analyzes the effectiveness of SVM models for classifying images, particularly focusing on the “Dogs vs Cats” and “Color Classification” datasets. The results are compared with alternative classification methods to assess accuracy and efficiency.

## Key Features
- Implementation of SVM for image classification
- Experiments conducted on "Dogs vs Cats" and "Color Classification" datasets
- Analysis of model performance and comparison with other algorithms
- Insights for improving decision boundaries in image classification tasks

## Datasets Used
- Dogs vs Cats Dataset
- Color Classification Dataset

## Technologies & Tools
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Python (suggested for implementation)
- Scikit-learn (for SVM and other ML comparisons)

## How to Use
1. Prepare image datasets as described in the paper.
2. Preprocess images and extract relevant features.
3. Train SVM models using the provided methodology.
4. Evaluate performance against benchmark classifiers.
